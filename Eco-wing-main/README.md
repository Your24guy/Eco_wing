# Image Data Analysis and Visualization Website

## Overview

Welcome to the Image Data Analysis and Visualization Website repository. This project provides a comprehensive platform for users to analyze various types of images and extract data, which is then visualized in the form of graphs. The website supports three primary types of image uploads: hyperspectral, multispectral, and thermal images.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload hyperspectral, multispectral, and thermal images.
- **Data Extraction**: The website processes the uploaded images to extract relevant data.
- **Data Visualization**: Extracted data is visualized using interactive graphs and charts for better understanding and analysis.

## Image Types Supported

1. **Hyperspectral Images**: These images capture a wide spectrum of light beyond the visible range, providing detailed information across various wavelengths.
2. **Multispectral Images**: These images capture data at specific wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, including visible and near-infrared light.
3. **Thermal Images**: These images capture the infrared radiation emitted by objects, allowing for the visualization of temperature variations.
